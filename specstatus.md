#Development Status as a function of Specification Coverage.

Another way to consider status is how much of the specification is covered by what has so far been 
implemented.
This gets tricky due to the interactions and permuations.

## Simple Spec Coverage
### Actions
There are 37 actions in the specification. All 37 actions are coded far enough to accept those 37 commands
and reject if the action is not one of those 37. 
So this is 100% coverage of this aspect.

### Targets
There are TBD targets in the specification.
None of these are yet covered so this is 0% coverage of this aspect.

ditto actuators and modifiers

linear add of 4 types yeilds 25% coverage.

### Action/Target Combo's
However the semantics of the commands are more complicated.
For example, there are valid action/target combinations as well as invalid action/target combinations.
