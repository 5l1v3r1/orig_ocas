ocas
=====

ocas - plural of oca, a edible tuber of Oxalis Tuberosa, a wood sorrel of the Andes; 
or maybe it's an acronym OCAS - OpenC2 API Simulator.

Ocas is an OTP application written in erlang to:
- prove out the OpenC2 spec (see http://openc2.org/ and https://github.com/OpenC2-org/)
- be a viable simulator for testing OpenC2 code and scenarios
- be a template for developing actual openc2 applications (ie replace the simulator code with code to actually perform the real function)

Build
-----

    $ rebar3 compile

Build & Test
-----

    $ rebar3 ct

Organization of this software
-----

The directory structure is follows the erlang OTP convention. Of interest:
- ./rebar.config contains the dependencies for building
  * cowboy is used for the webserver
  * jsx is used for json creation/parsing
  * lager is used for logging
  * shotgun is used just in testing as an http test client
- ./test contains tests for ct to execute. A test-driven-development is being attempted (eg first write a test, have it fail, and then develop the code to get it to pass, iterate).
- ./apps/ocas/src contains the meat 
  * ocas.app.src - OTP application resource file
  * ocas_sup.erl - OTP supervisor
  * ocas_app.erl - API for ocas
