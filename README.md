or maybe it's an acronym OCAS - OpenC2 API Simulator.

Ocas is an OTP application written in erlang to:
- prove out the OpenC2 spec (see blah blah X)
- be a viable simulator for testing OpenC2 code and scenarios
- be a template for developing actual openc2 applications (ie replace the simulator code with code to actually perform the real function)
